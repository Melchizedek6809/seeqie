An image viewer for your (sixel capable) terminal.

This is the result of a weekend experiment where I was trying to figure out if
one could build a simple image viewer using bash and img2sixel.  The result works
suprisingly well and is something I use from time to time if I want to take a
quick glance at some pictures.

## Usage
Just start this script and you should see a gallery of the current directory, you
can use hjkl to navigate and press the spacebar to enlargen the currently selected
image. Press space again to return to the overview.

Only really tested in mlterm, xterm might work though.

I am unlikely to continue work on this, I will however review and merge pull
requests :)
